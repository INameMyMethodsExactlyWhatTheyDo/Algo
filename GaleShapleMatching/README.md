# Stable matching problem

The program will match graduate studetns to professsors(advisors)
Prefessors prefer students with higher GPA
Students have their own set of preferances

Professors will "make offers" to students and students pick the best match for them

There are given problem sets as inputs

To run the program
./run.sh  

It will run through every input problem set

A stable matching is always possible
